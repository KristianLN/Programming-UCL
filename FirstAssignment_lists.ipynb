    "**A short description of this assignment**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below follows three functions, where the first one ‘accounting’ answers question five in the assignment. Accounting is integrated into the main prompt, code block eight, where all the action happens. The second function, ’showouremployees,’ answers question eight and it can be executed in code block nine. The third function is a function that checks the inventory file and returns the current stock level which answers question seven. The fourth and final function is ’orderengine,’ and t is the backbone of the main prompt. We will return the main prompt in a short moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below ’orderengine’ follows the fifth code block, which answers question one and partly question six, by presenting the selection and its inventory.\n",
    "The sixth code block adds the two new kinds to the available selection and updates the inventory, thereby answering question two and partly question six.\n",
    "The seventh code block answers question three, and partly question 6, by deleting the discontinued kind and updating the inventory.\n",
    "The eighth code block answers question seven, by utilizing function three to keep check with the stored inventory file to ensure that we don’t run our of Majings. For know, we jump over code block eight and focuses on code block nine. The ninth code block utilizes function two, and answers question 8 by storing the employees in as CSV file, and prints through the function.\n",
    " \n",
    "Finally, code block eight – the main prompt. It should first of all be explored, as it is very user-friendly. It allows the user to specify kind and amount and it ensures that only whole amounts are ordered. Furthermore, it keeps checking with the inventory, such that the customer does not get disappointed by ordering something that isn’t deep fried yet and ready for delivery. If you are dissatisfied with your order after a short review, you have the option to specify it again.\n",
    "All in all, explore the possibilities!\n",
